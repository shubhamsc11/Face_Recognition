# About
In this project, I am bulid how to detect face recognition using python. I am doing this using the concepts of computer vision using the OpenCV library and FaceRecognition.

# Is recognition different from detection?

Detection:– 
The ability to detect if there is some 'thing' vs nothing. 

Recognition:– 
The ability to recognize what type of thing it is (person, animal, car, etc.) 

Identification:– 
The ability to identify a specific individual from other people.

# Technology Used

1. Python3
2. Python Libraries
3. OpenCV
4. Face_detection
5. Face_recognition

# Installation

Windows:

  pip install face_recogition
	
  pip install opencv-python
  
  
# Libraries used

1. cv2 : OpenCV is a huge open-source library for computer vision, machine learning, and image processing.
 
2. face_recognition : Recognize and manipulate faces from Python or from the command line with the world’s simplest face recognition library.

3. os : The OS module in Python provides functions for interacting with the operating system. OS comes under Python's standard utility modules. 
  
4. cv2_imshow() : OpenCV-Python is a library of Python bindings designed to solve computer vision problems. cv2. imshow() method is used to display an image in a window.

5. numpy : NumPy is a Python library used for working with arrays. It also has functions for working in domain of linear algebra, fourier transform, and matrices.


# Usage Example

In this test example you can see here, first image before the face detect and the second is detect face in whole image.
