# About

In this project, I have built how to detect face with face recognition using python. I have done this project on the concept of computer vision, also I have used OpenCV library and Face Recognition.

# Is recognition different from detection?

𝐃𝐞𝐭𝐞𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧:– 
The ability to detect if there is some 'thing' vs nothing. 

𝐑𝐞𝐜𝐨𝐠𝐧𝐢𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧:– 
The ability to recognize what type of thing it is (person, animal, car, etc.) 

𝐈𝐝𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐢𝐟𝐢𝐜𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧:– 
The ability to identify a specific individual from other people.

# Libraries used

1. cv2 : OpenCV is a huge open-source library for computer vision, machine learning, and image processing.
 
2. face_recognition : Recognize and manipulate faces from Python or from the command line with the world’s simplest face recognition library.

3. os : The OS module in Python provides functions for interacting with the operating system. OS comes under Python's standard utility modules. 
  
4. cv2_imshow() : OpenCV-Python is a library of Python bindings designed to solve computer vision problems. cv2. imshow() method is used to display an image in a window.

5. numpy : NumPy is a Python library used for working with arrays. It also has functions for working in domain of linear algebra, fourier transform, and matrices.


# Usage Example

In this test example you can see here, first image before the face detect and the second is detect face in whole image.
